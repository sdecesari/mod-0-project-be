## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Mistakes are learning opportunities and a big part of coding.
- Setting SMART goals, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. I have never heard this acronym before and I love it.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I tend to be good at problem solving but it takes me too long to ask for help when I need it.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- A conditional statement controls the conditional instructions.
- `if the outside temp is 100 it is really hot outside`
- `if the outside temp is 75 it is warm outside`
- `if the outside temp is 20 it is cold outside`
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- To run the right statement based on the information inputed
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
- `if temp > 100
  puts "It is really hot outside!"
- end`
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- You can add elsif or else
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
- `outside_temp = 100
- if temp >= 100
-  puts "It is really hot outside"
- elsif temp == 75
-  puts "It is warm outside"
- else temp <= 20
-  puts "It is cold outside"
- end`
