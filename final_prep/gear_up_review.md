### Reflections

#### 1. What are your reflections from the video?
- I am not surprised. I have learned a lot about implicit biases taking psychology and women's studies in college. I also worked at a law firm where they had us take the implicit bias quiz to understand our own biases and how how the impacts our choices. They took responsibility for their own biases about hiring women attorneys and started to do blind interviews.

#### 2. In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
- Like I said, I have taken the implicit bias quiz before and I know what mine are. Knowing that helps me be conscious and aware so I can keep my biases in check.

#### 3. What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your product?
- I have strived to get out of the healthcare world but I would actually like to build a software that actually works for pediatric healthcare agencies. So many systems only do half of what a pediatric agency needs and the rest is useless. I think understanding that children with disabilities is often overlooked when building software for healthcare agencies will help create a system that actually works for them as well as adults.

### Intersectionality

#### 1. When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
- I am aware that I am a small petit woman and I am neurodivergent.

#### 2. What strength does your identity give you? How will you utilize those at Turing?
- I have learned how to speak up for myself being so small and being neurodivergent. I can bring an understanding of being the underdog and not processing information the same way as others. Making me very patient and allowing others to speak and making them feel comfortable enough to speak up.

#### 3. How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has their been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
- I value every persons uniqueness and find that part of being a human beautiful. Everyone is different in their values and perception of the world and honoring and accepting each individual for who they are will undoubtably let them know they are in a safe space to be their best selves. I do a lot of work with advocacy groups in Colorado for children with disabilities because I see how this population of children are ignored by school systems and healthcare insurance.

#### 4. How ill you strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?
- I like to say my ADHD is my super power and I love that I get to say I am neurodivergent. It kind of makes me feel like a bad ass! One aspect of having ADHD for me is hyperfocus. Meaning once I am hooked on something I am all in. So what I bring is the ability to hyperfocus and get things done.
