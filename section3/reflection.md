## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* It is a little hard to get used to the Pomodoro technique and to stop my flow when I feel locked in but it is nice to give myself a break and I understand how this actually helps my productivity.
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* Setting my intentions worked really well for me. I was really focused on the tasks I decided needed to get done. I was fairly accurate with my times but needed to give myself a little more than I thought I needed.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* A hash allows you to index anything and create an association from one thing to another and an array is an ordered index of any objects.
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
* pet_store = {'dog food' => 5, 'cat toy' => 10, 'dog bone' => 8}
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
* puts states['IA']
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
* puts states.keys
* puts states.values
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* You can use a hash to create a grocery list. this is better because I can find the value of a key if I don't know the location of the array
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* For exercise 39 I still don't understand what "puts '-' * 10" does. I tried playing with it by changing the amount and deleting it but it didn't seem to change anything.
