# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
p "#{name} must not return to Hogwarts!"# YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = 'Shirley'
is_hungry = 'Thai'
number_of_pets = 2
p "Hi my name is #{first_name}! I am hungry for #{is_hungry}. I have #{number_of_pets} pets!"
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain. I decided based on the information I just learned on how to put in
# strings and variables. I now know that to set a variable I have to create
# a rule to assign the variable to


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
students = 30
p students + 4

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
p "There are #{healthy_snacks} healthy snacks and #{junk_food_snacks} junk food snacks."

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect? Yes
